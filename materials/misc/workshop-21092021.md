## Data Hazards list  
You can get to the detailed descriptions of the Hazards from the table of links above, but for reference here is a list of their names.

* Data hazard  
* Reinforces exising biases  
* Ranks or classifies people  
* High environmental cost  
* Lacks community involvement  
* Danger of misuse  
* Difficult to understand  
* May cause direct harm  
* Privacy  
* Automates decision making  
* Lacks informed consent  


## (Reminder from slides) Feedback that would be helpful

* Do prepared data hazard labels help in imagining worst case scenarios?   
* Does discussing as a group help to apply them?  
* Is it worthwhile for project-owners?  
* What credit (if any) would audience-members want or need?  
* Are there any suggested tweaks to labels, or new labels?
