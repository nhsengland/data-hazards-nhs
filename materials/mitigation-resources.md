# Hazard Mitigation Resources

Many researchers, companies and communities are working hard to develop tools and resources
that can help make data science research and development safer.
This page is an opportunity to signpost to those projects and tools we know of that
might help those looking for ways to implement safety precautions in their work
to prevent Data Hazards.

If you have a tool to add, please submit a pull request with the
relevant template, or if you don't use GitHub please send us an email.
