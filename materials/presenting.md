# Presenting your Data Hazards

Present hazards alongside your work to:

1. ensure those who use your work in the future use it safely.
2. illustrate that you have considered how to conduct your work safely.
3. remind others that ethics is important and should be a standard part of data science practice.

## Data Hazards in your repository

We have created a (currently internal) [example of how you could add data hazards to your README.md][nhs-data-hazards-example].

## Data Hazards in your paper/report

You could also look to include hazards in table format in a paper or report, similar to how Natalie, one of the lData Hazard Project originators, has done this [in her thesis][natalie-thesis]. Please note that this is an example from the Data Hazards Project itself, and does not originate from NHS England.

This analysis includes each Hazard, reasoning for whether or not it applies, and safety precautions taken and/or that future people need to take in order to use the work safely.

## Other presentation formats

We are aware of [previous attempts to generate images of data hazards][gareth-image-generator] undertaken by contributors to the Data Hazards Project. Please note that this currently includes older versions of the Data Hazards.
