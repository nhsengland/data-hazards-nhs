## Description

The accuracy of the underlying data is not known and so its use may lead to erroneous results or introduce bias.

## Examples

__Example 1__: Metabolic modelling where inaccurately labelled conversions (e.g. due to computational prediction) might lead to unexpected products being produced by engineered pathways.

## Safety Precautions

Attempt to classify uncertainty if possible to better inform decisions and understand the range of possible outcomes.
