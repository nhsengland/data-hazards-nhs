# Presenting your Data Hazards

After analysing your project against the Hazards in the way that suits you best we think that the best way to use the Data Hazards is to present them with your work.
Some reasons for presenting the Hazards are:

1. It ensures people who use your research in the future use it safely.
2. It illustrates that you have considered how to conduct your work safely.
3. It reminds other people that ethics is important and should be a standard part of research practice.

This page includes ways that you could present the Hazards with your project.
For examples of how other people have implemented these suggestions then please go to the [Examples](examples) page.

## In a paper or report

You can include the Hazards analysis as part of a paper or a report.
Usually our analyses include each Hazard, your reasoning for whether or not it applies, and safety precautions that you have taken in the research and/or that you think future people need to take in order to use your research safely.
This often works well in a table format, and you can see a good example of this in [Natalie's thesis](https://nataliezelenka.github.io/phenotype_from_genotype/c04-snowflake/7-discussion.html#ethics-self-assessment).

Alternatively you could report your analysis [using one of our suggested templates](self-assessment) and host this on an online repostory like the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and link to it as supplementary material.

## In a presentation

You can include the images of the Hazards that you think apply as part of a presentation you are making about your work.
One of our contributors has [created a tool](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-hazards/pull/101) to generate an image of all the Hazards you think apply, which will be available soon to use on the website.

## On a GitHub repository

Thanks to another of our [contributors](https://github.com/PogromcaPapai), you could also include the Data Hazards that apply to a project in the `README.md` file of a GitHub repository.
We will post instructions soon of how to use this feature.
We do recommend that if you are including the images of the Data Hazards you also link to where visitors can find your reasoning and the safety-precautions, which could be included in the repository with any code.
