# Facilitating Tips

## Share the Code of Conduct

We have a code of conduct available to use if you would like, but also feel free to develop and use your own.
It's important to remind people to be respectful towards one another during the discussion, and for people to know what to do
if they feel they have seen or experienced unacceptable behaviour.

## Facilitation Do's and Don'ts

| Don’t  | Do  |
|---|---|
| Start without a knowing who’s on the call.  | Begin by opening the floor for people to introduce themselves.  |
| Open the discussion with a generic question (e.g.: “What do you think?”).  | Open the discussion by framing questions that you have prepared (e.g.: “I will ask about specific labels” or “I will ask about the ethical implications of the project’s different methods and objectives”).  |
| Allow people to speak over each other or interrupt others.  | Point out and challenge those who interrupt or speak over others. Remind the attendees that they agreed to the Code of Conduct.  |
| Dismiss views or be condescending.  | Facilitate discussions around new topics that arise from the group. Encourage people to share their views and clarify where necessary.  |
| Come unprepared!  | Be ready to explain the Data Hazard Labels, and be open to their different interpretations.  |
| Lose your temper!  | Be respectful. As a facilitator, you must champion the Code of Conduct.  |
| Lose control of the session or time-keeping.  | Facilitate the session to “flow” through a beginning, middle and end. Whilst the beginning may be slow, the middle should be where most ideas are shared and all attendees given a chance to voice their views. The end is where you summarise what was discussed during the breakout room and bring the discussion to a “natural” close.    |

## Data Hazard labels specials

There are some aspects of the Data Hazard labels that require some specific focus from the facilitator. These are:

- Keep project owners to their 5-minute allotted slot.
- Only allow factual clarification questions from the audience members.
- Ensure that project owners do not speak after their allotted time during the breakout.
- Be prepared to prompt discussion about the Data Hazards based on your knowledge of them.
