# Workshop Structure

To begin with we will introduce you to the Data Hazard labels and what a workshop would usually look like.
This includes the _ethos_ of a workshop, which focusses on the importance of multiple perspectives.

## Workshop roles

Facilitators:

- Probably you!
- There to run the workshop and help everyone get the most out of it.
- This involves managing each of the breakout rooms and supporting the discussions.

Audience Members:

- There to find out more about the projects and provide feedback.
- Combination of different types of people.
- Your decision about whether they are ‘experts’ or not (both can be interesting!)
See more about who to invite in the 'Identifying your audience' section.

Project Owners:

- There to have their project discussed by the audience members.
- Seeking feedback on an idea or project.
See more about how to support project owners in the 'Working with project owners' section.

## Timings

We use the following timings for the Data Hazard workshop, it lasts between 90 minutes and 2 hours.
The workshops use a version of a technique from social work known as ['The Reflective Team'](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-15877-8_324-1).
This is designed to help ensure that both the audience and the project owner get an opportunity to speak and listen.

- 5 mins: Housekeeping
- 20 mins: Data Hazards intro:
  - what are the data hazard labels?
  - why?
  - case study
- 45 mins: Project discussion in smaller groups using the reflective team exercise:
  - 5 minute project presentation
    - what's the project and who is involved?
    - what are it's aims?
    - what data and methods does it use?
    - what are it's potential applications (if any)?
  - 1 minute audience thinking time
  - 5 minutes audience asks clarifying questions to the project owner
    - Audience will ask factual questions only,  e.g. a good question “What does the training data look like?” A bad question “Do you think your work is biased?”
    - Project owner will answer factually only.
  - 5 minutes filling out form (what hazard labels apply) before discussion
  - 20 minutes discussion (project owner listens without speaking)
  - 2 minutes fill in hazards again
  - 5 minutes: project owner speaks while the audience are quiet, saying:
    - What from the discussion resonated the most with them
    - What resonated least with them
- 10 mins: (Back in the main room) Collecting feedback and wrapping up.

## Workshop Ethos

We think it's important that the workshops are run with the following things in mind:

- Multiplicity of perspectives​
  - Everyone has different lived experiences and as a result different views​
  - These views us to find importance in different places
  - Only by considering a range of perspectives can we thoroughly consider ethics.
- No ‘wrong’ answers
  - We are aiming to explore potential avenues of interest that might not have occurred to the project owner.
- Aiming to prompt discussion and thought, not to settle on yes/no decisions
