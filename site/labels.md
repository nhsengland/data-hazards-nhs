# Data Hazard labels

On this page you can see an overview of the current Data Hazards with short descriptions. Click on each for their full information.
Sub-headings also present Hazards which serve as 'expansion packs' for those using Data Hazards in specific fields.
We welcome you to suggest changes, so please check our [contribution guidelines](contribute) if you would like to or scroll down for current suggestions below.

You can [download a printable set of the core Data Hazards cards here](_static/DataHazards_PrintableCards.pdf).

Each individual Data Hazard page contains:

- A __title__, __description__ and __icon__ to describe the Hazard.
- __Examples__ to clarify what the hazard covers.
- __Safety Precautions__ as suggestions of how Hazards could be mitigated.

:::{dropdown} Why are the Hazard Labels designed this way?
:color: success

Please know that __we don't want these labels to scare anyone away from considering ethics or from doing data science__, and we will do everything that we can to make applying Data Hazards labels as welcoming and approachable as possible, but also have some good reasons for choosing these images.

We chose this format because of the similarity to [COSHH hazard labels](https://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/labelling-packaging/hazard-symbols-hazard-pictograms.htm) - hazard labels for chemicals.
We made this choice because we want a similar response from people:

1. Attention-grabbing, asking people to stop and think, and take the safety precautions seriously, rather than as an optional extra.
2. We're asking people to __"handle with care"__, not to stop doing the work. We still use chemicals, but we think about how it can be done safely and how to avoid emergencies.
3. They are familiar, especially to scientists, who (within universities) tend to have the least experience of applying ethics.

::::{grid-item-card} Reinforces Existing Biases
:img-top: images/hazards/reinforce-bias.png
:img-alt: A red diamond shaped outline (like a warning sign) with a dark head and shoulders, who has a white triangle in their mind. They are looking out at a black circle, a black square and a larger white triangle just ahead of them. This indicates that the largest shape is the one that they think of.
:link: hazards/reinforces-biases
:link-type: doc

Reinforces unfair treatment of individuals and groups. This may be due to for example input data, algorithm or software design choices, or society at large.

__21.06.2024: v1.1 - Add Synthetic Biology Hazard labels__
Changes made by [@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara) to reflect new additions formally proposed by
authors of [the paper in Synthetic Biology](https://doi.org/10.1093/synbio/ysae010).

__29.05.2024: Put labels in alphabetical order__
[@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara)

__06.12.2022: Update new Hazard labels__
[@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara)
Updated all the images of the Hazards with our new labels designed by the amazing [Yasmin Dwiputri](http://yasmindwiputri.com/)!

__07.03.2022: Move Data Hazards to individual pages__
[@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara)
Moved all of the Hazards to their own individual pages, and linked them from the original sphinx panels.
Also capitalised all of the names so that they are consistently named.
This should make it easier for people to contribute to a single Hazard and record their contribution against it :)
