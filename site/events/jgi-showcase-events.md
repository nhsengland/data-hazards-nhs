# JGI Showcase events

We are currently in the process of planning Data Hazards events to be part of the [JGI Showcase in June 2022](https://bristol.ac.uk/golding/get-involved/showcase-2022/).
We have plans for two potential events:

1. __Design-your-own Data Hazards label:__ we hope to invite the public to craft their own [Data Hazards label](../data-hazards) and tell us what data science and ethics issues are most important to them, and collect their ideas on how to make the label descriptions examples and safety precautions as clear and useful as possible.
2. __Data Hazards workshop:__ we hope to apply data science hazard labels to research, company and (local) government projects. If you have a project you'd like to discuss, please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk).
