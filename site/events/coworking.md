# Community co-working calls

Our community co-working calls are held every other Friday through Spring and Summer 2022.
If you are interested in contributing to the project we would love for you to come along - it is somewhere that you can share your ideas or feedback, or just ask how to contribute.
We are more than happy for you to come if you would like some help using GitHub too.
